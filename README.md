# 📝 Text Generation using Deep Learning

This project demonstrates **text generation** using a neural network trained on a corpus of text. The model learns language patterns and can generate new, coherent sequences based on a seed input.

---

## 📌 Objective

To train a deep learning model on a text corpus and generate human-like text using sequence prediction.

## 🔧 Requirements

Install the following dependencies to run the notebook:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow
```

---

## 📊 Dataset

The notebook uses a plain text corpus for training. This can be:

* A book or article (e.g., Shakespeare, News articles)
* Any large block of natural language text

Preprocessing steps include:

* Lowercasing
* Tokenization
* Creation of input-output pairs for the model

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture

Typical architecture includes:

* Embedding Layer
* LSTM/GRU Layer
* Dense Output Layer with Softmax activation

The model predicts the next word/character in a sequence.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Open `TextGeneration.ipynb`.
3. Run all cells sequentially:

   * Preprocess the text.
   * Train the model.
   * Generate new text by feeding a seed string.

---

## 🧪 Sample Output

```text
Seed: "the sun was"
Generated: "the sun was shining bright as she walked through the silent streets with nothing but"
```

> Output varies with temperature and randomness settings.

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* Use larger and more diverse text datasets.
* Try character-level generation.
* Implement attention or Transformer-based models (like GPT-2/GPT-Neo).
* Deploy via web app or Telegram bot.
